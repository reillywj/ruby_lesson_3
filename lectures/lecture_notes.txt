Part I
Must be able to read and decipher OO code to truly understand Rails

Setting Ruby aside and focusing on Web Development basics

Agenda:
-HTTP
  Request
    GET: link or type into address bar
      -Designed to retrieve information
      -Good for submitting parameters (?some_para=true&another_param=50...)
      -parameters are exposed in URL
      -smaller payload
    POST: form submission usually
      -forms are POSTs, parameters are submitted in the body
        a) Has a larger payload (=> value of the parameters; can also be attachments)
        b) More secure
  Response


  Web application v. Website
  -Application
    -handles the requests and responses
    -has database
  -Site
    -Static html
    -no database
    -rendering a bunch of static html
    -requests/responses being handled by the server and not the application
-MVC

-Kicking off our project w/ Sinatra
