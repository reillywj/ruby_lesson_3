------Web Development------
Main goal is working with HTTP
HTTP: stateless protocol
As web developers, spend all our time managing statelessness
Understanding HTTP, and learning how to process requests and responses is the goal

Choices
1.  Not using OOP to manage code in solutions; goal is HTTP development
2.  Not including databases in this section; Using session instead, cookie-backed.  Reason is that many people get stuck on db concepts. Relational dbs are the next course

TIP: Be creative and have fun
